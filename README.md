# ARM Worldwide - Static HTML/CSS/JS

Pure HTML + CSS + JavaScript site scaffolded with Bootstrap 5.3. Ready to map 1:1 to your Figma design.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click) or serve locally.
2. Edit styles in `assets/css/styles.css` and scripts in `assets/js/main.js`.
3. Replace placeholder images in `assets/img/`.

### Local development server (optional)

You can use any static server. With Python:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 5500
# then open http://localhost:5500
```

## Figma Mapping

- We will translate Figma's color, typography, spacing tokens to CSS variables in `:root`.
- Section structure already scaffolded: `#hero`, `#features`, `#gallery`, `#pricing`, `#faq`, `#contact`.
- Provide the Figma link and exportable assets; we will replace placeholders and align spacing.
